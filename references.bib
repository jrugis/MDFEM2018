@article{fox1985,
	Abstract = {Xerostomia is the subjective sensation of oral dryness. Although it is most commonly associated with salivary gland dysfunction, it may also occur with normal gland activity. Xerostomia may be an early symptom of several morbid systemic conditions with important implications for the medical and dental management of patients. Oral dryness also has negative effects on an individual's emotional well-being and quality of life. The complaint of xerostomia necessitates a complete evaluation of a patient's general health, salivary gland function, and oral motor and sensory abilities. The salivary gland assessment includes symptom review, analysis of glandular secretions, scintiscanning, and minor labial gland biopsy. No single component is sufficient to adequately diagnose the presence, extent, or cause of salivary dysfunction. Treatment of a dry mouth, to date, is mainly palliative in nature, with the intent of preserving oral structures and functions. Better therapies are essential in the management of xerostomia, whatever the cause. The importance of xerostomia as a symptom is increasingly recognized in medicine and dentistry. The dentist is commonly the first health professional to hear this complaint and may be critical in directing a full and appropriate evaluation.},

Elucidating the functions of the various salivary components as well as the mechanisms underlying normal salivary gland physiology is essential for developing rationales for the prevention and treatment of oral pathology. Individuals suffering from the consequences of a variety of forms of salivary gland dysfunction will benefit from therapies developed as the result of these advances. The application of relatively simple techniques for evaluating the functional status of salivary glands and salivary composition will aid in the identification of individuals most susceptible to oral disease.},

@article{nauntofte1992,
	Abstract = {The primary secretion from exocrine gland cells is a fluid rich in Na+ and Cl- with a plasmalike ionic composition. Activation of specific receptors on the plasma membrane by hormones and neurotransmitters, which leads to activation of the phosphoinositol metabolism, results in release of Ca2+ from internal Ca2+ stores. Intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) then rises simultaneously at both the basolateral and luminal parts of the acinar cell, reaching maximum values within 1 s after stimulation. In parotid acinar cells, increased [Ca2+]i activates the opening of maxi K+ channels located on the basolateral membrane and Cl- channels presumably located on the luminal membrane, resulting in rapid loss of K+ and Cl- and water and cell shrinkage. Extracellular electroneutrality is maintained by a paracellular Na+ flux into the lumen. Because of the simultaneous activation of K+ and Cl- channels, secretion occurs at a virtually constant membrane potential of about -60 mV. After maximal muscarinic cholinergic stimulation, loss of K+, Cl-, and water results in an approximate 25% reduction in cell volume within 10-15 s after receptor activation. Concomitant with loss of Cl-, there is a loss of HCO3- from the cell, causing a decrease in intracellular pH of 0.1 pH units because of the carbonic anhydrase-mediated conversion of CO2 into H+ and HCO3-. H+ generated from the metabolism and HCO3- production is compensated for by extrusion of H+ by a Na(+)-H+ exchange mechanism, which is responsible for approximately 75% of net Na+ gain that occurs after stimulation. Increased [Na+]i activates the Na(+)-K+ pump, which in turn extrudes Na+ from the cells. In both the unstimulated and stimulated states, cellular production of HCO3- can drive a net uptake of Cl- via the Cl(-)-HCO3- exchange mechanism operating in parallel with the Na(+)-H+ exchanger. The operation of the Cl(-)-HCO3- exchanger is, together with a Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl- cotransport system, essential for maintainance of a high [Cl-]i both in the unstimulated state and during Cl- reuptake.},

	Abstract = {We construct a mathematical model of Ca(2+) wave propagation in pancreatic and parotid acinar cells. Ca(2+) release is via inositol trisphosphate receptors and ryanodine receptors that are distributed heterogeneously through the cell. The apical and basal regions are separated by a region containing the mitochondria. In response to a whole-cell, homogeneous application of inositol trisphosphate (IP(3)), the model predicts that 1), at lower concentrations of IP(3), the intracellular waves in pancreatic cells begin in the apical region and are actively propagated across the basal region by Ca(2+) release through ryanodine receptors; 2), at higher [IP(3)], the waves in pancreatic and parotid cells are not true waves but rather apparent waves, formed as the result of sequential activation of inositol trisphosphate receptors in the apical and basal regions; 3), the differences in wave propagation in pancreatic and parotid cells can be explained in part by differences in inositol trisphosphate receptor density; 4), in pancreatic cells, increased Ca(2+) uptake by the mitochondria is capable of restricting Ca(2+) responses to the apical region, but that this happens only for a relatively narrow range of [IP(3)]; and 5), at higher [IP(3)], the apical and basal regions of the cell act as coupled Ca(2+) oscillators, with the basal region partially entrained to the apical region.},
